Dotfiles
========

This is a collection of my public dotfiles.


Setting up
----------

Included is a script, ``symlink-dotfiles.py``, which will link all the required resources to your 
home directory.

.. note:: Remember to run this script as the users you desire to setup.

.. attention:: This is not a dotfiles maintainer, it's just a litle helping hack.
